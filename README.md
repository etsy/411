Search scheduling
-----------------

Configure Searches to periodically run against a variety of data sources. You can define a custom pipeline of Filters to manipulate any generated Alerts and forward them to multiple Targets.


Alert management
----------------

Review and manage Alerts through the web interface. You can apply Renderers to alerts to enrich them with additional metadata.


Use cases
=========

- You want to detect when certain log lines show up in ES.
- You want to detect when a Graphite metric changes.
- You want to detect when a server stops responding
- You want to manage alerts through a simple workflow.

And much more!
